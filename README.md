# Background
As part of the Data Science At Scale Coursera Specialization, we were asked to analyze crime data from Seattle and/or San Francisco.
The jupyter notebook stored here presents the results obtained with the Seattle data.

# Main results
From the analysis of crime data collected during the Summer 2014 by the Police department of Seattle, we found that thefts constitute the most important offense in terms of volume. While this is true across the city, District E seems strongly affected, especially during weekend nights, i.e. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays between ~00:00 and 01:00, when such activities increase in frequency with respect to weeknights. Car prowl is the predominant type of theft there.
